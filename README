NAME
    Devel::PerlySense - IntelliSense for Perl

DESCRIPTION
    PerlySense is an IntelliSense style utility for editors.

    Conveniently navigate and browse the code and documentation of your
    project and Perl installation.

SYNOPSIS
  From Emacs
    C-p C-c -- Class Overview -- Show information about the Class at point
    or the current Class.

    C-p C-d -- Smart docs -- Show docs (POD/signature/etc) for the symbol
    (module/method/sub) at point. A doc hint is displayed in the message
    area (for methods and subs), or a new POD buffer is created (for
    modules).

    C-p C-g -- Smart go to -- Open file at proper location for module,
    method/sub declaration for the symbol (module/method/sub) at point. If
    no sub declaration is available (like for generated getters/setters),
    any appropriate POD is used instead.

    C-p C-r -- Run file -- Run the current file using the Compilation mode
    and the settings appropriate for the source type.

    C-p m f -- Perl Module open File -- Open the source file of the module
    at point.

    As you can see, PerlySense duplicates some of the functionality in
    cperl-mode, and does more in certain areas.

  From Vim
    There is no integraton with Vim available. Well, yet.

    Someone may want to write it.

  From other editors
    Any editor that is programmable and that can call a shell script could
    take advantage of PerlySense to implement something similar to the Emacs
    functionality. And most editors are programmable by the authors, if not
    by the users.

  From the command line
    This is not very convenient unless you let your editor do it. See the
    "perly_sense" in bin script on how to do this.

    There is one useful command though; cache all the modules in @INC:

        perly_sense process_inc

  From Perl
    See the source of the "perly_sense" in bin script, or the t directory.

INSTALLATION
    Install required modules from CPAN.

  Emacs installation
    Copy the file "emacs/perly-sense.el" in editors to your Emacs script dir
    (which should be in the load-path), and add this to the end of your
    .emacs config file:

      ; PerlySense
      (load "perly-sense")
      (global-unset-key "\C-p")
      (global-set-key (kbd "\C-p \C-d") 'perly-sense-smart-docs-at-point)
      (global-set-key (kbd "\C-p \C-g") 'perly-sense-smart-go-to-at-point)

    Adjust according to preference: the key mappings will replace the C-p
    command which obviously will be fantastically annoying for you if you
    don't use the arrow keys to move around. This is just how I use Emacs,
    and I expect this will make you go *&&*%!

    Please don't. The default key bindings will be changed before the first
    real release. Suggestions welcome.

    (actually, these keys are currently bound from within the .el file, so
    make sure you comment them out if you're not happy with them)

GETTING STARTED WITH EMACS
    Open one of your Perl source files.

  Smart docs
    C-p C-d is the "Smart docs" command. It brings up documentation for
    what's at point.

    Put the cursor on the "method" word of a $self->method call and press
    C-p C-d and wait until a documentation hint for the method call is
    displayed briefly in the message buffer. PerlySense will look in base
    classes if the method can't be found in the current class.

    Put the cursor on the "method" word of an $object->method call and press
    C-p C-d to see the docs hint. PerlySense will look through all your
    "use" modules (and their base classes) for the method call and try to
    identify the best match.

    Note! The first time each module is parsed this will take a second or
    two, and the very first time you run the command with lots of "use"
    modules it's bound to take longer than that.

    Put the cursor on a module name and press C-p C-d to bring up a new
    buffer with the POD for that module (this is similar to the cperl-mode
    feature, only a) not as good, but b) it works on Windows).

    Press C-p C-d with nothing under the cursor brings up a POD buffer for
    the current file.

  Smart go to
    C-p C-g is the "Smart go to" command. It's similar to Smart Docs, but
    instead of bringing the docs to you, it brings you to the definition of
    what's at point.

    The definition can be either the sub declaration, or if the declaration
    can't be found (like for auto-generated getters/setters, autoloaded subs
    etc), the POD documentation for the sub.

    Before you go anywhere the mark is set. Go back to earlier marks
    globally with C-x C-SPC, or locally with C-u C-SPC.

  Go to Class
    C-p m f -- Go to Class (will be changed to C-p g c) at point.

  Class Overview
    Pressing C-p C-c will bring up the Class Overview of the Class name at
    point, or otherwise the current Class (the active Package).

    Example class CatalystX::FeedMe::Controller::Feed

      * Inheritance *
           [ Class::Accessor                     ]
        +> [ Class::Accessor::Fast               ] <-----+
        |  [ Catalyst::AttrContainer             ] ------+---------------------------+
        |    |                                           |                           v
        +- [ Catalyst::Base                      ] --> [ Catalyst::Component ] --> [ Class::Data::Inheritable ]
           [ Catalyst::Controller                ]
           [<CatalystX::FeedMe::Controller::Feed>]

      * Uses *
      [ Data::Dumper      ] [ XML::Atom::Syndication::Content ] [ XML::Atom::Syndication::Feed ]
      [ Template::Filters ] [ XML::Atom::Syndication::Entry   ] [ XML::Atom::Syndication::Link ]

      * NeighbourHood *
      [ CatalystX::FeedMe::DBIC ] [<CatalystX::FeedMe::Controller::Feed    >] -none-
                                  [ CatalystX::FeedMe::Controller::FeedItem ]       
                                  [ CatalystX::FeedMe::Controller::Homepage ]       
                                  [ CatalystX::FeedMe::Controller::Root     ]       

      * Structure *
      ;;;';;;;;;;{;";}{;;;;{}"";{}"";";}{;;;';';";;;{;'";;';;;};';}S{;";"";;}S{;'{}{"};;;}S{;;;;";"
      ;;};

    The Inheritance section shows all Base classes of the Class. Inheriting
    from something like Catalyst is hopefully the hairiest you'll see.

    The Uses section shows all used modules in the Class.

    The NeighbourHood section shows three columns (1: parent dir, 2: current
    dir, 3: subdir for the current class) with Classes located nearby.

    The Structure section shows a Signature Survey of the file, showing an
    extreme abbreviation of the source. The intent is to convey an ambient
    feel for what the source contains. It's not clear this is a useful
    thing.

    When in the Class Overview buffer:

    g -- Go to the file of the thing at point.

    d -- Documentation for the thing at point.

    c -- Class Overview for the thing at point. RET does the same.

    I -- Move point to the Inheritance heading in the buffer.

    U -- Move point to the Uses heading in the buffer.

    H -- Move point to the NeighbourHood (mnemonic: 'Hood) heading.

    M -- Move point to the Methods heading.

    N -- Move point to the 'new' method in the buffer (if any).

    q -- Quit the Class Overview buffer.

  Run File
    C-p C-r -- Run the file of the current buffer using the Compilation
    mode.

    Files are run according to the source type, which is determined by the
    file name (see the config file). The default for .t files is to run
    "prove -v", for .pm files "perl -c", etc.

    The file is usually run from the project root, and the @INC is set
    appropriately. You can also specify additional @INC directories in the
    config.

    If any errors are encountered they are highlighted in the compilation
    buffer and you can use C-c C-c to move from one error to the next within
    the source buffer.

    If you wish to start many runs at the same time, rename the compilation
    buffer with M-x rename-buffer.

    (Note: at the moment, all this only works with .t files)

  Go to Error line
    If you don't use Run File on tests, this may be handy.

    C-p g e -- If point is located on an error line from a syntax error, or
    a stack trace from the debugger or similar, go to that file+line.

    If no file name can be found, prompt for a piece of text that contains
    the file+line spec. The kill ring or clipboard text is used as default
    if available (so it's easy to just copy the error line from the shell,
    run this command and hit return to accept the default text).

ON PARSING PERL
    Since Perl is so dynamic, a perfect static analysis of the source is
    impossible. But not unusably so. Well, hopefully. Most of the time.

    Because of this PerlySense is not about exact rules, but about
    heuristics and a 90% solution that isn't perfect, but good-enough.

    PerlySense tries to take advantage of the fact that Perl code is more
    than the plain source file. The source lives in a context of POD and a
    directory structure and common Perl idioms.

    Sometimes when PerlySense can't make a decision, you're expected to chip
    in and tell it what you meant.

    Sometimes it won't work at all.

    Such is the way of dynamic languages.

    If it works for you, brilliant, use it to be more productive. If not...
    there's always Java >:)

BUGS AND CAVEATS
  BUG REPORTS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    "bug-devel-perlysense@rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Devel-PerlySense>. I
    will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress
    on your bug as I make changes.

  CAVEATS
    Tab/space isn't supported by PPI yet, but it's supposed to be. So using
    Tab instead of spaces won't work properly.

  KNOWN BUGS
    PPI is kinda slow for large documents. Lots of objects being created
    etc.

    There are certainly edge cases. Bug reports with failing tests
    appreciated :)

  setFindProject([file => $file], [dir => $dir])
    Identify a project given the $file or $dir, and set the oProject
    property.

    If there is already a project defined, don't change it.

    If no project was found, don't change oProject.

    Return 1 if there is a valid project, else 0.

    Die on errors.

  oDocumentParseFile($file)

  oLocationSmartGoTo(file => $fileOrigin, row => $row, col => $row)
    Look in $file at location $row/$col and determine what is there.
    Depending on what's there, find the source declaration/whatever, find it
    and return an Devel::PerlySense::Document::Location object.

    Currently supported:

      $self->method, look in current file and base classes. If no sub can
      be found, look for POD.

      $object->method, look in current file and used modules. If no sub
      can be found, look for POD.

      Module::Name (bareword)

      Module::Name (as the only contents of a string literal)

    If there's nothing at $row/col, or if the source can't be found, return
    undef.

    Die if $file doesn't exist, or on other errors.

  oLocationSmartDoc(file => $fileOrigin, row => $row, col => $row)

    Depending on what's there, find the documentation for it and return a
    Document::Location object with the following rhProperty keys set:

      text - the docs text
      found - "method" | "module"
      docType - "hint" | "document"
      name - the name of the thing found

    the details.

    Return hash ref with (keys: "dir_run_from", "command_run",
    "type_source_file"), or die on errors (like if no Project could be
    found).

    dir_run_from is an absolute file name which should be the cwd when
    command_run is executed.

    type_source_file is something like "Test", "Module".

  classNameAt(file => $fileOrigin, row => $row, col => $row)
    Look in $file at location $row/$col and determine what class name that
    is.

    Die on errors.

  fileFindModule(nameModule => $nameModule, dirOrigin => $dirOrigin)
    Find the file containing the $nameModule given the $dirOrigin.

    Return the absolute file name, or undef if none could be found. Die on
    errors.

  oDocumentFindModule(nameModule => $nameModule, dirOrigin => $dirOrigin)
    Find the file containing the $nameModule given the $dirOrigin.

    Return a parsed PerlySense::Document, or undef if none could be found.
    Die on errors.

IMPLEMENTATION METHODS
  fileFindLookingAround($fileModuleBase, $dirOrigin)
    Find the file containing the $fileModuleBase given the $dirOrigin.

    Return the file name relative to $dirOrigin, or undef if none could be
    found. Die on errors.

  dirFindLookingAround($fileModuleBase, $dirOrigin, [$raDirSub = [".", "lib", "bin"]])
    Find the dir containing the $fileModuleBase (relative file path) given
    the $dirOrigin. For all directories, also look in subdirectories in
    $raDirSub.

    Return the absolute dir name, or undef if none could be found. Die on
    errors.

  fileFindLookingInInc($fileModuleBase)
    Find the file containing the $nameModule in @INC.

    Return the absolute file name, or undef if none could be found. Die on
    errors.

    Return the $nameModule converted to a file name (i.e. with dirs and .pm
    extension).

  fileFoundInDir($dir, $fileModuleBase)
    Check if $fileModuleBase is located in $dir.

    Return the absolute file name, or "" if not found at $dir.

  textFromPod($pod)
    Return $pod rendered as text, or die on errors.

  oLocationRenderPodToText($oLocation)
    Render the $oLocation->rhProperty->{pod} and put it in
    rhProperty->{text}.

    Return the same (modified) $oLocation object, or undef if no
    rhProperty->{pod} property ended up as text (after this operation, there
    is content in rhProperty->{text}).

    Return undef if $oLocation is undef.

    Die on errors.

  aDocumentFindModuleWithInterface(raNameModule => $raNameModule, raMethodRequired => $raMethodRequired, raMethodNice => $raMethodNice, dirOrigin => $dirOrigin)
    Return a list with Devel::PerlySense::Document objects that support all
    of the methods in $raMethodRequired and possibly the methods in
    $raMethodNice. Look in modules in $raNameModule.

    The list is sorted with the best match first.

    If the document APIs have one or more base classes, look in the @ISA
    (depth-first, just like Perl (see perldoc perltoot)).

    Warn on some failures to find the location. Die on errors.

  aApiOfClass(file => $fileOrigin, row => $row, col => $row)
    Look in $file at location $row/$col and determine what package is there.

    Return a two item array with (Package name,
    Devel::PerlySense::Document::Api object with the likely API of that
    class), or () if none was found.

    Die if $file doesn't exist, or on other errors.

  aDocumentGrepInDir(dir => $dir, rsGrepFile => $rsGrepFile, rsGrepDocument => $rsGrepDocument)
    Return a list with Devel::PerlySense::Document objects found under the
    $dir, and that return true for the grep sub $rsGrepFile and
    $rsGrepDocument.

    If any found file couldn't be parsed, skip it silently from the list.

CACHE METHODS
  cacheSet(file => $file, key => $key, value => $valuex)
    If the oCache isn't undef, store the $value in the cache under the total
    key of ($file, $file's timestamp, $key, and the PerlySense VERSION).

    $value should be a scalar or reference which can be freezed.

    $file must be an existing file.

    Return 1 if the $value was stored, else 0. Die on errors.

  cacheGet(file => $file, key => $key)
    If the oCache isn't undef, get the value in the cache under the total
    key of ($file, $file's timestamp, $key) and return it.

    $file must be an existing file.

    Return the value, or undef if the value could not be fetched. Die on
    errors.

  cacheKeyTotal($file, $key)
    If oCache is undef, return undef.

    Otherwise, return the total key of ($file, $file's timestamp, $key, and
    the PerlySense VERSION).

    $file must be an existing file.

    Die on errors.
