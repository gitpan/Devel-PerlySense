NAME
    Devel::PerlySense - Perl IDE with Emacs frontend

DESCRIPTION
    PerlySense is a Perl IDE backend that integrates with editor frontends,
    currently Emacs.

    Conveniently navigate and browse the code and documentation of your
    project and Perl installation.

    Run tests and scripts and syntax check source with easy navigation to
    errors/warnings/failing tests.

    Automate common editing tasks.

    Highlight syntax errors, warnings and Perl::Critic complaints in the
    source while editing.

SYNOPSIS
  From Emacs
    C-o C-o -- Overview -- Show information about the Class at point or the
    current Class.

    C-o C-d -- Docs -- Show docs (POD/signature/etc) for the symbol
    (module/method/sub) at point. A doc hint is displayed in the echo area
    (for methods and subs), or a new POD buffer is created (for modules).

    C-o d i -- Document Inheritance -- Show the Inheritance hierarchy for
    the current Class in the echo area.

    C-o d u -- Document 'use Module' statements in the echo area.

    C-o C-g -- Go To -- Open file at proper location for module, method/sub
    declaration for the symbol (module/method/sub) at point. If no sub
    declaration is available (like for generated getters/setters), any
    appropriate POD is used instead.

    C-o g u -- Go to the 'use Module' section of the current buffer.

    C-o g n -- Go To 'new' -- Go to the 'new' method of the current class.

    C-o g b -- Go To Base Class -- Open the file of the base class of the
    current class. This will take you up one level in the inheritance
    hierarchy.

    C-o g m -- Go To Module -- Open the source file of the module at point.

    C-o g v -- Go To Version Control -- Go to the Project view of the
    current Version Control system.

    C-o g t o -- Go To Tests - Other Files -- Go to any related test or
    source files given a Devel::CoverX::Covered covered db.

    C-o C-r -- Run file -- Run the current file using the Compilation mode
    and the settings appropriate for the source type (Test, Module, etc.).
    Highlight errors and jump to source with C-c C-c.

    C-o e m u -- Edit - Move Use Statement -- Move the 'use Module'
    statement at point to the 'use Module' section at the top.

    C-o e t c -- Edit Test Count -- Increase the test count (e.g. "tests =>
    43")

    C-o a t -- Assist With Test Count -- Synchronize invalid test count in
    .t file with the *compilation* buffer.

    Flymake may be used to highlight syntax errors and warnings in the
    source while editing (continously or at every save).

  From Vim
    There is no integraton with Vim available. Well, not properly anyway. If
    you pass the option

     --io_type=editor_vim

    to perly_sense, the output format will use the Vim serializer. But not
    all commands use this format, and the Vim side of things aren't done
    quite yet.

    It's in the works.

  From other editors
    Any editor that is programmable and that can call a shell script could
    take advantage of at least some parts of PerlySense to implement
    something similar to the Emacs functionality. And most editors are
    programmable by the authors, if not by the users.

  From the command line
    *   Create Project

          perly_sense create_project [--dir=DIR]

        Create a PerlySense project in DIR (default is current dir).

        If there is already a project.yml file, back it up with a datestamp
        first.

        (Note that you don't need to create a project before start using
        PerlySense. Read more below).

    *   Process Project Source Files

          perly_sense process_project

        Cache all modules in the project. (not implemented)

    *   Process Source Files in @INC

          perly_sense process_inc

        Cache all the modules in @INC.

        This is a useful thing to do after installation (and after each
        upgrade), but it will take a wile so put it in the background and
        let it churn away at those modules.

        *   Unix

              perly_sense process_inc &        # (well, you knew that already)

        *   Windows

              start /MIN perly_sense process_inc

    *   Get Info

          perly_sense info

        Display useful information about what the current project directory,
        user home directory, etc. is.

INSTALLATION
  perly_sense installation
    Install required modules from CPAN. Recommended: use a configured CPAN
    shell, like this:

      cpan Devel::PerlySense

    and be done with it. When everything is installed, verify by running

      perly_sense info

  Supporting modules
    This isn't needed to begin with, but may be very useful if you have a
    lot of tests to navigate: Devel::CoverX::Covered.

  Emacs installation
    Make sure the Devel::PerlySense CPAN module is installed, it contains
    the required elisp files which will be loaded automatically with the
    following in your .emacs config file:

        ;; *** PerlySense Config ***

        ;; ** PerlySense **
        ;; The PerlySense prefix key (unset only if needed, like for \C-o)
        (global-unset-key "\C-o")
        (setq ps/key-prefix "\C-o")


        ;; ** Flymake **
        ;; Load flymake if t
        ;; Flymake must be installed.
        ;; It is included in Emacs 22
        ;;     (or http://flymake.sourceforge.net/, put flymake.el in your load-path)
        (setq ps/load-flymake t)
        ;; Note: more flymake config below, after loading PerlySense


        ;; *** PerlySense load (don't touch) ***
        (setq ps/external-dir (shell-command-to-string "perly_sense external_dir"))
        (if (string-match "Devel.PerlySense.external" ps/external-dir)
            (progn
              (message
               "PerlySense elisp files  at (%s) according to perly_sense, loading..."
               ps/external-dir)
              (setq load-path (cons
                               (expand-file-name
                                (format "%s/%s" ps/external-dir "emacs")
                                ) load-path))
              (load "perly-sense")
              )
          (message "Could not identify PerlySense install dir.
        Is Devel::PerlySense installed properly?
        Does 'perly_sense external_dir' give you a proper directory? (%s)" ps/external-dir)
          )


        ;; ** Flymake Config **
        ;; If you only want syntax check whenever you save, not continously
        (setq flymake-no-changes-timeout 9999)
        (setq flymake-start-syntax-check-on-newline nil)

        ;; ** Color Config **
        ;; Emacs named colors: http://www.geocities.com/kensanata/colors.html
        ;; These colors work fine with a white X11 background. They may not look
        ;; that great on a console with the default color scheme.
        (set-face-background 'flymake-errline "antique white")
        (set-face-background 'flymake-warnline "lavender")
        (set-face-background 'dropdown-list-face "lightgrey")
        (set-face-background 'dropdown-list-selection-face "grey")


        ;; *** PerlySense End ***

    The load path is handled automatically by asking "perly_sense
    external_dir" where the elisp source was installed (that way,
    Devel::PerlySense and the elisp is always in sync).

  Emacs Configuration
    The most important config you can change is the prefix key.

    The default, \C-o, seemed to have a rater low useful-to-keystroke ratio
    and so was a strong candidate for stealing for this much more important
    purpose :)

    If you want to use flymake to do background syntax and Perl::Critic
    checks, set ps/load-flymake to t (this is a very nifty thing, so yes you
    want to do this) and configure the colors to your liking.

    Note: This also needs to be enabled on a per-project basis (see below).

GETTING STARTED WITH EMACS
  Smart docs
    C-o C-d is the "Smart docs" command. It brings up documentation for
    what's at point.

    Put the cursor on the "method" word of a $self->method call and press
    C-o C-d and wait until a documentation hint for the method call is
    displayed briefly in the echo area. PerlySense will look in base classes
    if the method can't be found in the current class.

    Put the cursor on the "method" word of an $object->method call and press
    C-o C-d to see the docs hint. PerlySense will look through all your
    "use" modules (and their base classes) for the method call and try to
    identify the best match.

    Note! The first time each module is parsed this will take a second or
    two, and the very first time you run the command with lots of "use"
    modules it's bound to take longer than that.

    Put the cursor on a module name and press C-o C-d to bring up a new
    buffer with the POD for that module (this is similar to the cperl-mode
    feature, only a) not as good, but b) it works on Windows).

    Press C-o C-d with nothing under the cursor brings up a POD buffer for
    the current file.

  Document Inheritance
    C-o d i will briefly display the Inheritance hierarchy for the current
    Class in the echo area. This is similar to the Class Overview (see
    below).

  Document Used Modules
    C-o d u will briefly display the list of modules used from the current
    buffer in the echo area. This is similar to the Class Overview (see
    below).

  Smart go to
    C-o C-g is the "Smart go to" command. It's similar to Smart Docs, but
    instead of bringing the docs to you, it brings you to the definition of
    what's at point.

    The definition can be either the sub declaration, or if the declaration
    can't be found (like for auto-generated getters/setters, autoloaded subs
    etc), the POD documentation for the sub.

    Before you go anywhere the mark is set. Go back to earlier marks
    globally with C-x C-SPC, or locally with C-u C-SPC.

  Go to Base Class
    C-o g b takes you up one level in the inheritance hierarchy. If the
    current class has many base classes, you'll have to choose which one to
    go to.

    If the current method is implemented in that base class, go to the sub
    definition.

    After going to the Base Class, the Inheritance tree of that class is
    displayed in the echo area.

  Go to the 'new' method
    C-o g n takes you to the definition of the 'new' method of the current
    class (in this class, or a parent class).

  Go To 'use Module' section
    C-o g u takes you to the line below the last 'use Module' statement in
    the the current buffer.

  Edit Move 'use Module' Statement
    C-o e m u -- If point is on a line with a single 'use Module' statement,
    set mark and move that statement to the end of the 'use Module' section
    at the top of the file.

    This is typically useful when you realize you need a module, e.g.
    Data::Dumper, in the middle of the file, but you don't want to leave
    where you are just to fiddle with adding it.

    So type the 'use Module' statement, hit C-o e m u to move it, see that
    it got moved to a good place and hit C-u C-SPC to return to where you
    were, and continue doing what you where doing.

  Go to Module
    C-o g m -- Go to Module at point.

  Go to Version Control
    C-o g v -- Go to the Project view for the current Version Control
    system. This typically displays the change status of the files in the
    project. A dired of the Project dir is used in lieu of a VCS.

    First, try to go to an existing VC project buffer.

    If there is no VC buffer open, find out what VCS is used, and display
    the Project view.

    Supported VC systems:

    *   Subversion -- Quick intro to *svn-status*

        _ (underscore) - display only the changed files (toggle)

        n, p, m, u -- next, previous, mark, unmark

        E -- diff the changes in the current file

        c -- commit file(s)

        r -- revert file(s)

        X v -- resolve conflict (or X X, I'm not sure what the difference
        is)

        etc, etc, etc, do a C-h m to see all the goodies.

  Class Overview
    Pressing C-o C-o will bring up the Class Overview of the Class name at
    point (not yet implemented), or otherwise the current Class (the active
    Package).

    Example class CatalystX::FeedMe::Controller::Feed

      * Inheritance *
           [ Class::Accessor                     ]
        +> [ Class::Accessor::Fast               ] <-----+
        |  [ Catalyst::AttrContainer             ] ------+---------------------------+
        |    |                                           |                           v
        +- [ Catalyst::Base                      ] --> [ Catalyst::Component ] --> [ Class::Data::Inheritable ]
           [ Catalyst::Controller                ]
           [<CatalystX::FeedMe::Controller::Feed>]

      * Uses *
      [ Data::Dumper      ] [ XML::Atom::Syndication::Content ] [ XML::Atom::Syndication::Feed ]
      [ Template::Filters ] [ XML::Atom::Syndication::Entry   ] [ XML::Atom::Syndication::Link ]

      * NeighbourHood *
      [ CatalystX::FeedMe::DBIC ] [<CatalystX::FeedMe::Controller::Feed    >] -none-
                                  [ CatalystX::FeedMe::Controller::FeedItem ]
                                  [ CatalystX::FeedMe::Controller::Homepage ]
                                  [ CatalystX::FeedMe::Controller::Root     ]

      * Bookmarks *
      - Todo
      Feed.pm:83: remove duplication

      * API *
      \>mutator_name_for
      ->new
      ->path_prefix
      ...

    The Inheritance section shows all Base classes of the Class. Inheriting
    from something like Catalyst is hopefully the hairiest you'll see.
    Classes inherit from their parents upwards in the diagram unless there
    is an arrow pointing elsewhere.

    The Uses section shows all used modules in the Class.

    The NeighbourHood section shows three columns (1: parent dir, 2: current
    dir, 3: subdir for the current class) with Classes located nearby (this
    can be bizarrely huge (and take a long time) if you browse your site_lib
    or similar).

    The Bookmarks section shows matches for bookmark definitions you have
    defined in the Project config (see below).

    the API section shows things that look like methods and properties of
    the class (sub declarations, $self method calls,
    $self->{hash_ref_keys}):

      ->method_in_this_class
      \>method_in_base_class  (note the arrow coming from above)

    Private methods (named with a leading _) are displayed as regular
    methods. Same goes for private methods in base classes, except when the
    base class is outside of your Project (like for CPAN modules).

    Why is this?

    If it's your code base you're interested in everything, but if you
    inherit from a CPAN module, you don't care (you even shouldn't care)
    about the implementation of that module.

    Note that you can still see the private methods of those modules by
    doing a Class Overview on them, or any of the modules outside your
    current Project (thereby changing the current Project to the directory
    where those modules are installed).

    When in the Class Overview buffer:

    g -- Go to the file of the thing at point (Module/Method/Bookmark)

    d -- Documentation for the thing at point (Module/Method)

    c -- Class Overview for the thing at point. RET does the same.

    I -- Move point to the Inheritance heading in the buffer.

    U -- Move point to the Uses heading in the buffer.

    H -- Move point to the NeighbourHood heading (mnemonic: 'Hood).

    B -- Move point to the Bookmarks heading.

    A -- Move point to the API heading.

    N -- Move point to the '->new' method in the buffer (if any).

    q -- Quit the Class Overview buffer.

  Run File
    C-o C-r -- Run the file of the current buffer using the Compilation
    mode.

    Files are run according to the source type, which is determined by the
    file name (see the config file). The default for .t files is to run
    "prove -v", for .pm files "perl -c", etc. This can be configured per
    Project (see below).

    The file is run from the Project root directory or from the file
    directory depending on the file type, and the @INC is set appropriately.
    You can also specify additional @INC directories in the Project config.

    (Note that you can configure whatever type of run profile you like, not
    just Perl source files.

    As a taste of what's possible, imagine that you have a test framework
    with .yml acceptance test data files and a corresponding yml-runner.pl
    script. With the x option (not implemented) you can edit the .yml file
    and type C-o C-r to run the acceptance test the same way as a regular
    test.)

    If any warnings, errors or test failures are encountered, they are
    highlighted in the *compilation* buffer. Use C-c C-c to move from one
    error to the next. Or press RET on a highlighted line.

    If you wish to start many runs at the same time, rename the compilation
    buffer with "M-x rename-buffer".

  Re-run File
    Invoke C-o C-r from within the *compilaton* buffer to re-run (M-x
    recompile) the file. Useful when you have skipped around the source
    fixing errors and the .t file isn't visible.

    C-o r r -- If not even the *compilation* buffer is visible, issue Re-Run
    File from anywhere to bring it up and re-run.

  Edit Test Count
    C-o e t c -- Increase the test count number in the line resembling

      use Test::More tests => 43;

    without moving point. The current and new test count is reported in the
    echo area.

    Increase with the numeric argument (C-u 18 C-o e t c), or default 1.

  Assist With Test Count
    C-o a t -- If the test count in a .t file is out of sync with what's
    correctly reported when running the test in the *compilation* buffer
    (see Run File), use this command to update the .t file.

    This updates the

      use Test::More tests => 43;

    line in the current buffer, so be sure to only run this when the
    *compilation* buffer contains the run result of this buffer.

  Go to Tests - Other Files
    C-o g t o -- In a test file, navigate to the source files that are
    covered by that test file. In a source file, navigate to test files
    covering the file.

    This requires that Devel::CoverX::Covered is installed and a
    Devel::Cover cover_db in the project root directory.

    See Devel::CoverX::Covered for details.

  Go to Error line
    If you run tests in a regular shell (inside Emacs or in a terminal
    window), this may be handy.

    C-o g e -- If point is located on an error line from a syntax error, or
    a stack trace from the debugger or similar, go to that file+line.

    If no file name can be found, prompt for a piece of text that contains
    the file+line spec. The kill ring or clipboard text is used as default
    if available (so it's easy to just copy the error line from the
    terminal, run this command and hit return to accept the default text).

  Flymake Introduction
    "Flymake performs on-the-fly syntax checks of the files being edited
    using the external syntax check tool (usually the compiler). Highlights
    erroneous lines and displays associated error messages."

    Flymake is included in Emacs 22 (or available from
    http://flymake.sourceforge.net/, put flymake.el somewhere in your
    load-path. [[[explain how to fix brokenness?]]] ).

    PerlySense uses flymake to check syntax, Perl Critic, etc.

    Three inconveniences with vanilla Flymake are fixed: no proper @INC,
    only .pl files, and "perl -c" warns about redefined subs for recursively
    used modules (which is perfectly fine Perl).

    Syntax errors and warnings both use the error face.

    Perl Critic violations use the warning face.

  Enabling Flymake
    First off, flymake itself needs to be enabled. Refer to the Emacs
    Installation description above.

    This will enable Flymake for all cperl-mode buffers, causing Emacs to
    call perly_sense for each check.

    PerlySense won't do anything at this point though. You still need to
    configure what should happen during a flymake.

    Create a PerlySense Project directory (see below) and look in the
    project.yml file for instructions on how to configure Flymake
    activities.

    Set "syntax" / "critic" to 1 to enable them.

    The primary reason "syntax" is turned off by default is that it's a
    potential security hole; running "perl -c" on a file will not only check
    the syntax; BEGIN and CHECK blocks are also executed. Doing that on
    random code may be considered... baaad.

    This way you can have Flymake enabled globally and still not run "perl
    -c" on everything that happens to be in a buffer.

  Using Flymake
    In the Project config file there are some hints on how to customize
    Flymake, when it should run, etc. You can also customize it with "M-x
    customize-group flymake".

    (Personally I find the nagging while I type very distracting, but I
    welcome the immediate feedback whenever I save the file. YMMV.)

    Look in the mode line for hints on whether there are any errors or
    warnings.

    C-o s n -- Go to the next Source error/warning.

    Display the error in the minibuffer. If the warning is from a
    Perl::Critic module, copy the module name into the kill-ring, so you
    easily can yank it into the .perlcritic config file to disable it. (not
    implemented)

    C-o s p -- Go to the previous Source error/warning.

    C-o s s -- Display the error/warning text of the current line.

  Assist With -- Regex
    Hit C-o a r to bring up the Regex Tool which will let you compose a Perl
    regular expression interactively with matching text highlighed.

    The Regex Tool appears in a new frame with three buffers: *Regex*,
    *Text* and *Groups*.

    If point is on a regular expression in the source code, that regex will
    be used to pre-populate the *Regex* buffer. (Not yet implemented)

    If there is a comment block just above the regex, it will be used to
    pre-populate the *Text* buffer. Note that it is very handy to document
    the regex with some sample input, so this is a good idea in general.
    (Not yet implemented)

    The contents of the *Regex* buffer should look e.g. like this:

      / part \s (\w+) \s no:(\d) /xgm

    *   You can use all the usual delimiters, such as / | {} () ", etc.

    *   You can put Perl comments below the regex to temporarily store
        chunks of regex code during prototyping.

    *   The modifiers work as expected, including /x and /g .

    The results in the *Groups* buffer are updated as you type in either the
    *Regex* or *Text* buffer.

    Use C-c C-c to force an update.

    Use C-c C-k to quit all the regex-tool buffers and remove the frame.

THE PERLYSENSE USER DIRECTORY
    PerlySense keeps a per-user directory to store cache files, logs, etc.
    The ".PerlySense" user directory is located under the first available of
    these environment variables:

      $APPDATA
      $ALLUSERSPROFILE
      $USERPROFILE
      $HOME
      $TEMP
      $TMP

    Run

      perly_sense info

    to see which directory is actually being used.

PROJECTS
    PerlySense has the concept of a Project root directory.

    Basically, this is where all the source lives, and where your program
    can go to find modules that are used. This is from where tests are run
    and files are found.

    You can specify the Project root dir explicitly for your applications.
    But if you don't, PerlySense will try and figure out what the Project
    root directory is from the context of the surrounding code.

    This means you can browse source code anywhere on your hard drive (e.g.
    @INC) without any special setup or configuration. Most things will just
    work, without any hassle.

    If you follow the standard directory structure for CPAN modules, the
    Project directory is typically the one which contains the Makefile.PL,
    the lib, bin, and t directory, etc.

  Identifying a Project root directory
    The fastest and most solid way for PerlySense to know which is the
    Project directory is to create a ".PerlySenseProject" directory with a
    config file in it. This is highly recommended for all of your own
    projects.

    The complete project identification strategy is as follows:

    *   First, if there is any directory upwards in the dirctory path with a
        ".PerlySenseProject" dir in it, that is the Project directory.

    *   Second, PerlySense will try figure out from where the current file
        (if any) was being required/used given the contained package names
        or used modules.

    *   Third, if that doesn't work, PerlySense will look for "lib" and "t"
        directories.

    If that doesn't work, PerlySense is lost and you really do need to
    create an explicit Project directory by running the following command in
    your intended Project root directory (that would typically be the
    directory which has a "lib" directory in it):

      perly_sense create_project

    Any existing ".PerlySenseProject/project.yml" config file will be
    renamed.

    Note that this all means that the current Project depends on which file
    you are looking at. If it's a file within the directory tree under a
    ".PerlySenseProject" directory, that's what the current Project is. But
    if you from that file do a Class Overview on an installed CPAN module,
    the current Project is deduced from that .pm file, typically making the
    current Project be the "lib" or "site_lib" of your local CPAN
    installation.

  Project Configuration
    The Project has a .PerlySenseProject/project.yml config file. Here you
    can change the name of the Project, add extra @INC directories, etc.

    There is a yaml-mode for Emacs, but I haven't got it to work properly
    (unless an infinite loop counts as "properly" these days). The
    shell-script-mode is good enough.

    The config file documentation is where it belongs, in the config file,
    so just take a look at it.

  perly_sense Project commands
      perly_sense create_project [--dir=DIR]

    Create a PerlySense project in DIR (default is current dir).

      perly_sense process_project

    Cache all modules in the project. (not implemented)

BOOKMARKS
    Bookmarks are regexes that may match against a single line. Each
    bookmark definition has a name/moniker under which the matches are
    grouped in the Class Overview display.

    The primary point of Bookmarks is to highlight unusual things in the
    source. The secondary to make it easy for you go navigate to them.

    This can be anything you like, but things that come to mind are:

    *   TODO comments

    *   FIXME/XXX/HACK comments

    *   Things you don't want left in the code, like

        Breakpoints ($DB::single = 1)

        Debugging warn/print statements

  Configuration
    Bookmarks are defined in the Project Config file (technical details are
    documented there).

KEY BINDING CONVENTIONS
    There is a system behind the chosen key bindings in PerlySense. Knowing
    the conventions will make it easier to remember everything.

  Convention: Action based
    The first level after the prefix key (C-o by default) is always an
    Action, e.g. Run, or Document.

    (In the case of C-o C-d for Document you can either think of it as
    "Document this for me!" or "Give me Documentation!".)

    With a verb at the first level rather than a noun, the Action can be
    context sensitive, "smart", or DWIMy.

    Smart Goto goes to whatever is under the cursor, be it a module name, a
    method call, a file name, or an error message.
    Run runs the file differently depending on what kind of file is open
    (tests are "proved", modules are syntax checked, scripts are run, etc).

  Convention: The Action as a Gateway
    The first level indicates the Action to perform, and has the Ctrl
    modifier as a "Smart" / DWIMy modifier. This is both so it's easy to
    type C-o C-r without releasing the Ctrl key, and to provide a gateway to
    more specific actions when typing the key without Ctrl.

    E.g. C-o C-r means "Run file", C-o r r means "Run - Re-run".

    E.g. C-o C-g means "Smart Goto", C-o g b means "Goto - Base Class", C-o
    g s means "Goto - SUPER Method".

  The Main Actions Areas
    (some of the main areas have no implementations yet)

    *   r -- Run

        Run files in various ways.

    *   g -- Go to

        Navigate to various locations in the source.

    *   d -- Document

        Bring up documentation.

    *   f -- Find

        Find/search and display things in the source.

    *   o -- Overview

        Bring up an overview of things.

    *   m -- forMat

        Reformat source.

    *   e -- Edit

        Perform smaller convenience editing task.

    *   E -- rEfactor

        Perform restructuring edits that don't impact
        functionality/behaviour.

  Explore Emacs key bindings
    Remember that you can use the usual Emacs feature to display possible
    key stroke completions by hitting C-h whenever in the key stroke
    sequence.

    E.g. Hitting C-o g C-h will list all available key strokes starting wiht
    C-o g.

  Changing key bindings
    Some key bindings may change over time as I figure out what works and
    what doesn't. Some key bindings may be reorganized to make more sense or
    to just work better.

IN CLOSING -- ON PARSING PERL
    Since Perl is so dynamic, a perfect static analysis of the source is
    impossible. But not unusably so. Well, hopefully. Most of the time.

    Because of this PerlySense is not about exact rules, but about
    heuristics and a 90% solution that isn't perfect, but good-enough.

    PerlySense tries to take advantage of the fact that Perl code is more
    than the plain source file. The source lives in a context of POD and a
    directory structure and common Perl idioms.

    Sometimes when PerlySense can't make a decision, you're expected to chip
    in and tell it what you meant.

    Sometimes it won't work at all.

    Such is the way of dynamic languages.

    If it works for you, brilliant, use it to be more productive. If not...
    well, there's always Java >:)

  CAVEATS
    Tab/space isn't supported by PPI yet, but it's supposed to be. So using
    Tab instead of spaces won't work properly.

  KNOWN BUGS
    PPI is kinda slow for large documents. Lots of objects being created
    etc.

    There are certainly edge cases. Bug reports with failing tests
    appreciated :)
