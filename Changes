* Run File uses the Project config, and supports syntax checking .pm
  files, running .pl files, etc. as well.

* New config keys added, so run "perly_sense create_project" to
  re-generate a default project.yml which you can then diff against
  the old one (renamed with datestamp).

* Flymake support - highlight syntax errors and warnings in the source
  while editing (continously or at every save).

  Note: new elisp file to install, and some .emacs configuration.



= 0.01_22 =

* Docs about projects, etc.

* If Run File is perfomed from within the compile buffer, do a
  recompile.

* C-p r r -- If not even the *compilation* buffer is visible, issue
  Re-Run File from anywhere.

* "perly_sense create_project" renames existing project.yml with
  datestamp

Stuff happened.

Time passed.

Code got written. Bugs were introduced and removed. Ideas were had,
fleshed out, xdiscarded. Sometimes implemented.

But that was then.
