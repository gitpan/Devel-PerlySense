= Feature oriented Revision history for Devel-PerlySense =



= 0.01_27

* Fixed annoying failing Win/Unix newline test. Nothing else.



= 0.01_26

* Fixed bug #30775: "Flymake not showing Perl::Critic warnings" which
  was caused by redirecting warnings into the debug log.

* Bookmark support (recreate the project config and check out the
  "bookmark" entry).



= 0.01_25

* Fixed: Flymake emits redefined warnings for subs with namespace
  qualifiers.

* Debug logging in the HOME/.PerlySense/log directory

* Warnings go to the debug log



= 0.01_24 =

* Fixed potential breaking flymake elisp.

* If the *compiation* buffer is already visible in any frame, switch
  to that first, so we don't get to see two *compiation* buffers next
  to each other. That just looks silly.

* Perl::Critic using Flymake - first draft



= 0.01_23 =

* Run File uses the Project config, and supports syntax checking .pm
  files, running .pl files, etc. as well.

* New config keys added, so run "perly_sense create_project" to
  re-generate a default project.yml which you can then diff against
  the old one (renamed with datestamp).

* Flymake support - highlight syntax errors and warnings in the source
  while editing (continously or at every save).

  Note: new elisp file to install, and some .emacs configuration.



= 0.01_22 =

* Docs about projects, etc.

* If Run File is perfomed from within the compile buffer, do a
  recompile.

* C-p r r -- If not even the *compilation* buffer is visible, issue
  Re-Run File from anywhere.

* "perly_sense create_project" renames existing project.yml with
  datestamp



= Earlier =

Stuff happened.

Time passed.

Code got written. Bugs were introduced and removed. Ideas were had,
fleshed out, xdiscarded. Sometimes implemented.

But that was then.
