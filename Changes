Feature oriented Revision history for Devel-PerlySense
======================================================

0.0206 -- 2012-10-20 17:23:47 UTC

* Bug #79817: "Go to Module" fails on numeric characters.
  Thanks to Mark A. Flacy for report and solution.


  
0.0204 -- 2012-06-17 12:52:45 UTC

* Bug #77711: Run ack with --nopager



0.0203 -- 2012-06-16 17:18:13 UTC

* Feature: identify base classes via "use parent".

* Correctly identify Test::Class .pm files as tests if they're below
  the t/ directory



0.0202 -- 2012-06-07 20:09:55 UTC

* Fixed deep recursion bug when a Module claims to be a base class to
  itself



0.0201 -- 2012-06-06 21:32:57 UTC

* Fixed deep recursion bug when finding a Module file, where
  e.g. Bar::Baz would be shadowed by Foo::Bar::Baz.



0.0200 -- 2012-06-01 11:37:30 UTC

* Test release



0.0199 -- whenever

* Feature: Added missing -i toggle for the ack command

  "C-o i" toggle  -i

* Feature: Go To Find Buffer -- "C-o g f" to go to the B<*grep*>
  buffer.



0.0198 -- whenever

* Feature: Edit - Add Use Statement using "C-o e a u". Add a 'use
  Module' statement to the 'use Module' section at the top. Default
  Module name is module at point.

* Changed Ack key bindings to use the C-o prefix instead of C-c, to
  avoid stomping on someone's personal config more than necessary.
  (also updated the Changes entry below to reflect the current
  bindings)



0.0197 -- 2012-05-29 22:39:02 UTC

* Fixed problem during startup where C-o f a won't work until the
  "grep" package is loaded (it's autoloaded during normal interactive
  use).

* Changed commands that run from the Project Directory so that they
  don't blow up if there is no Project Directory. Instead just run
  from the current directory.

* Add convenience key bindings for "Find with Ack" -- "C-o f a".

  When editing the ack command you can use the following keys to set options
  "C-o w" toggle  -w
  "C-o q" toggle  -Q
  "C-o a" use    --all
  "C-o p" use    --perl
  "C-o s" use    --sql

* Feature: Run File with Alternate Command using "C-u C-o C-r".  You
  need to configure the Alternate Command to do somethign useful in
  the PerlySenseProject config file.

* Feature: Debug File with Alternate Command using "C-u C-o r d".  You
  need to configure the Alternate Command to do somethign useful in
  the PerlySenseProject config file.



0.0195 -- 2012-05-21 13:55:44 UTC

* Fixed t/PerlySense-find-file-inc.t which fails if there is no
  .PerlySenseProject in the build directory (which there typically
  isn't).


0.0194 -- 2012-05-21 12:58:40 UTC

* Fixed dzil config re: $VERSION variable



0.0193 -- 2012-05-20 18:09:05 UTC

* Catch exceptions during flymake and log them to avoid returning a
  positive error code that flymake will interpret as "Configuration
  error has occurred while running" etc.

* Improve error reporting for badly formed YAML config files.

* #70203: Missing close paren in emacs lisp
  _Finally_ fixed pathetic elisp syntax error w/ missing closing paren.

  Thanks to SPACEBAT and Sebastian Willert for reporting



0.0191 -- 2011-07-31 21:07:42 UTC

* Config project/inc_dir now used not only to set @INC when running
  programs, but also to find files and modules.

* Running programs using the prepared shell commands now more solid
  across various Emacs versions / platforms.

* Provide a default .PerlySenseProject/.perlcritic file when running
  perly_sense create_project. (If you run this again, the existing project.yml
  will be backed up.)



0.0190 -- 2011-05-12 21:12:24 UTC

* #68144: Unable to install PerlySense-0.0189
  Thanks to David McWilliams for a quick bug report.



0.0189 -- 2011-05-08 22:55:00 UTC

Bug fix release. Thanks to John SJ Anderson for prodding me to get RT
patches applied.

* Bug #65259 - sub prototype causes failure in perl 5.12 in emacs on
  mac. Thanks to VANAMBURG for the bug report and fix.

* Bug #42827 - Flymake warnings not displayed with latest Perl::Critic
  Thanks to Jan Tatarik for the bug report and fix.

* Bug #61640 - perly-sense.el regexps
  Thanks to Kevin Ryde for the bug report and John SJ Anderson for the
  patch.



0.0188 -- 2011-05-08 21:15:38 UTC

* Dist::Zilla build files



0.0186
------

* Removed non ascii char form Build.PL to avoid not-utf8 warnings.



0.0185
------

* Fixed bad YAML in default config file which breaks YAML::Tiny
  1.46. Thanks to Thomas Kappler for finding this.

  !!!NOTE!!! If you have existing .PerlySense/project.yml files, they
  are broken. A scalar string with : followed by a space is illegal
  and now needs to be quoted.

  In the previous default config, the regex under "bookmark:" is
  broken and the "rex:" should now be
      - "qr/\# \s* TODO \s* : \s* (.+?) \s*$/x"

  Remember: you need to find *all* your .PerlySense/project.yml files
  and fix them:
    ack -fa | ack PerlySenseProject/project.yml

* Better error output when YAML::Tiny dies

* Updated default config to use "prove --nocolor". Because it's 2011
  now.



0.0184
------

* No-op



0.0183
------

* New command: C-o g r -- Go to Run buffer.

* Fixed Test::Class current method bug when re-running.



0.0182
------

* Minor "Test::Class" usability improvements.



0.0181
------

* Support for running a single method in Test::Class. Mark a method
  with C-o t m, then run the test class with C-o C-r as usual.



0.0180
------

* Adjusted "Find with Ack" to work with Emacs 23 as well.



0.0179
------

* Feature request from Joshua McMIchael: make flymake display its
  errors in the minibuffer.

  This is done automatically if the display isn't graphical, or if the
  ps/flymake-prefer-errors-in-minibuffer variable is customized.



0.0178
------

* Bug http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=42577
  - Test::More output "# Looks like you planned 1 test but ran 2."
    singular not recognized. Thanks to Kevin Ryde for noticing!
  - Also relaxed singular/plural for other phrases



0.0177
------

* Debugger
  - Fixed a bug with the working directory.
  - Proper docs



0.0176
------

* Run in Debugger -- C-o r d
  - !NOTE! Requires you to re-create the .project config file !NOTE!
  - Run current file from the project directory
  - With proper -I include directories




0.0175
------

* Fixed problem with shell dialect syntax in directory names for
  prepare-shell-command. Now works on Unixen too.



0.0174
------

* New specific Overview commands:
  - C-o o i -- Inheritance
  - C-o o a -- API
  - C-o o b -- Bookmarks
  - C-o o u -- Uses
  - C-o o h -- NeighbourHood

* Beta: Run calls to perly_sense as a prepared shell command, if the
  variable ps/use-prepare-shell-command is non-nil.

  (setq ps/use-prepare-shell-command t) to enable in your config.

  This will shave around 1.8s off each call, which is
  significant. This makes most things _a_lot_ snappier.

* Removed the NeighbourHood from Class Overview. This was making Class
  Overview too slow to be useful, and provided little benefit.

  You can still use C-o o h if you want to see the NeighbourHood.



0.0173
------

* Moved screen shots to web pages, linked from POD



0.0172
------

*Fixed bug: If displaying method docs with an =item in the POD, it
  will render with a warning.



0.0171
------

* Screenshots in the documentation and other docs improvements.



0.0170
------

* Find with Ack quotes the search properly.

* Find Sub Declarations and Find Method Calls identify methods when
  point is on the object too.



0.0169
------

* Find sub declarations in Project of method or name at point.
  C-o f s.

* Find method calls in Project of method or name at point.
  C-o f c.

* Fixed problem with missing --nogroup ack option on some
  environments.

* Better Find usability:
  - Sensible default point position in input buffer.

* Numerous minor POD fixes.



0.0168
------

* Find using "ack" in Project. C-o f a.

* Rearranged the docs to provide more readable sub headings.



0.0167
------

* Fixed bug: missing (require 'pc-select) in elisp.
  Thanks to Sebastian Willert for catching this.
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=41416



0.0166
------

* Removed "Coverage information loaded" message that appears when
  Devel::CoverX::Covered info is loaded. This messed up the echo area
  for other messages.

* Release related bugs fixed. Thanks to Lucien Hantute for spotting
  the reason.



0.0165
------

* Moose syntax plugin, supporting the "has", "extends", and "with"
  keywords. See the Devel::PerlySense::Plugin::Syntax::Moose docs.

  Not yet spliced off to its own distro.

* Test fix (accidental // as part of a path seems to break some
  platforms).



0.0164
------

* Moose plugin, supporting "extends" and "with". The plugin is still
  in this distro, it will eventually get it's own distribution.



0.0163
------

* Another attempt, this time by introducing files in otherwise empty
  directories. Maybe different versions of tar extract files
  differently.



0.0162
------

* Fucking about with this problem: http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=714227

  This attempt: http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=39804



0.0161
------

* Failed release



0.0160
------

* Git support (Magit) for the Version Control commands.
  See: http://zagadka.vm.bytemark.co.uk/magit/

* Fixed bug: Coverage visualization always instantiates an empty
  "covered" directory, even if there isn't any coverage to begin with.

* Fixed bug: Nothing happens after choosing between > 1 base classes
  in "Go to Base class" (response key named "class-description"
  instead of "class_description").



0.0159
------

* Go To Project's Other Files - C-o g p o -- If you have a
  .corresponding_files in the .PerlySenseProject directory, this will
  let you navigate to those other files. See File::Corresponding for
  more info.



0.0158
------

* Changed call to collect coverage information to be asynchronous.



0.0157
------

* Fixed (potential) bug in covered visualization, when trying to
  fontify a killed buffer.



0.0156
------

* Added configuration tips to the Cookbook on how to run Test::Class
  and custom test framework files.

* Go To Tests - Other Files: C-o g t o -- Now sub-aware, i.e. when the
  point is on a line with "sub name", the list is limited to that
  sub. Requires Devel::CoverX::Covered >= 0.011 .



0.0155
------

* Fixed various Coverage fontification bugs. This didn't work at all
  well with subs with _ in them.

* New customization -- only indicate bad subroutine coverage



0.0154
------

* New feature: Display code coverage in the source using
  Devel::CoverX::Covered.

  First release of this, so may be immature. Feedback wanted.

* Print out log file at beginning of doing process_inc or
  process_project

* New feature: "perly_sense log_file" prints the log file name. Useful
  for "tail -f `perly_sense log_file`.



0.0153
------

* Fixed http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=35934.

  "memory leak" during "perly_sense process_inc" caused by an
  in-memory cache of Perl documents.

* New feature "perly_sense process_project [--dir=.]".



0.0152
------

* All actions in perly_sense now use the serialization format, which
  means all actions can potentially work in Vim.



0.0151
------

* BIG CONFIG CHANGE! all Emacs variables are renamed from perly-sense-
  to ps/ . Update the section in your .emacs file that loads
  PerlySense!



0.0150
------

* If more than 30 items in a dropdown, use completing read instead.
  This is customized with the
  perly-sense-dropdown-max-items-to-display variable.



0.0149
------

* Go To Tests - Other Files: C-o g t o -- If you have
  Devel::CoverX::Covered installed and have build a cover_db in the
  project root directory, this command will let you choose to go to
  any related test or source files.

  See Devel::CoverX::Covered for details.

  Ironically, this isn't very well unit tested yet...



0.0148
------

* Eye-candy release: use dropdown-list.el when choosing between
  multiple classes.

* Note that two configuration colors were added, so revisit the "Emacs
  installation" section in the docs to set that up.


0.0147
------

* Vim serialization support



0.0146
------

* Edit Test Count: C-o e t c. Increase the test count specified by use
  "Test::More tests => 42;" and the like.

* Assist-with Test Count: C-o a t. Synchronize invalid test count in
  .t file with the *compilation* buffer.



0.0145
------

* Go to Version Control now properly supports: svn, none

* Doc Uses: C-o d u -- Display used Module in the echo area.

* Go To Uses: C-o g u -- Go to the 'use Module' section of the current
  buffer.

* Edit Move Use Statement: C-o e m u -- Move 'use Module' statement to
  the end of the 'use Module' section at the top of the file.



0.0144
------

* Go To 'new': C-o g n -- Go to the 'new' method of the current class.

* Go to Version Control: C-o g v -- Go to the Project view of the
  current Version Control system.

* Document Inheritance: C-o d i -- display the Inheritance hierarchy
  for the current class.

* Documentation: Key binding conventions



0.0143
------

* More clever Goto Base Class:

  - If target source file is already open, don't move point to top of
    file by default

  - If the current location is in a sub
    - display that sub if it exists in any base class
    - go to that sub in the base class if it exists



0.0142
------

* C-o g b - Goto Base Class. Basic functionality, but can handle MI,
  letting you choose which class to go to.



0.0141
------

* Bundle regex-tool 1.2

  C-o a r - Assist-with Regex



0.0140
------

* In Class Overview, display documentation for each method, or the
  method name if no doc is found. This is taken from the POD for each
  method.



0.0139
------

* Fiddled with failing test, fixed typo.



0.0138
------

* Tried fixing test which failed on some platforms.



0.0137
------

* Debug diagnostics for the failing test that doesn't appear on
  Windows.



0.0136
------

* In Class Overview, don't display private methods in base classes
  outside the current Project. TBD: config setting for this

* Made headings in Class Overview less huge

* Fixed bug with missing face dependency loaded from another Emacs package



0.0135
------

* Changed key binding for Class Overview from C-o C-c (focusing on
  Class) to C-o C-o (focusing on Overviwe). This is to bring it in
  line with the convention of having the first keystroke be an
  "action", not an "object".

* "perly_sense info" displays Version

* Removed dependency on "grep-mode" which was only used for the faces.

* Faces are now dealt with properly in the customize-group perly-sense
  (if you use PerlySense in text-only mode, please let me know if it
  looks ok).



0.0134
------

* Docs and Goto now works on Methods in the Class Overview.

* Bug: Goto method declaration goes to the POD rather than the sub {}
  if found in base classes.



0.0133
------

* Cookbook.pod added

* Class Overview
  - reorder the things displyed to bring the more useful stuff to the top
  - display API methods in columns



0.0132
------

* "perly_sense info" provides useful information about what the
  current project directory, user home directory, etc. is.

* Class Overview lists the API, i.e. methods and properties.



0.0131
------

* Fixed broken Build.PL which didn't properly install the .el files
  into the lib directory. The Makefile.PL worked earlier though...



0.0130
------

* Fist non-developer release!

* New .emacs load procedure, read the docs again.

* Automatic identification of elisp files using "perly_sense
  external_dir".

* Configurable Emacs prefix. Default is C-o.



0.01_29
-------

* Fixed failing test.

* Fixed broken initial project config (bad bookmark regexp)



0.01_28
-------

* Fixed another most likely insignificant failing test, added debug
  output for another one. Bring on the CPAN testers! (kudos guys!)



0.01_27
-------

* Fixed annoying failing Win/Unix newline test. Nothing else.



0.01_26
-------

* Fixed bug #30775: "Flymake not showing Perl::Critic warnings" which
  was caused by redirecting warnings into the debug log.

* Bookmark support (recreate the project config and check out the
  "bookmark" entry).



0.01_25
-------

* Fixed: Flymake emits redefined warnings for subs with namespace
  qualifiers.

* Debug logging in the HOME/.PerlySense/log directory

* Warnings go to the debug log



0.01_24
-------

* Fixed potential breaking flymake elisp.

* If the *compiation* buffer is already visible in any frame, switch
  to that first, so we don't get to see two *compiation* buffers next
  to each other. That just looks silly.

* Perl::Critic using Flymake - first draft



0.01_23
-------

* Run File uses the Project config, and supports syntax checking .pm
  files, running .pl files, etc. as well.

* New config keys added, so run "perly_sense create_project" to
  re-generate a default project.yml which you can then diff against
  the old one (renamed with datestamp).

* Flymake support - highlight syntax errors and warnings in the source
  while editing (continously or at every save).

  Note: new elisp file to install, and some .emacs configuration.



0.01_22
-------

* Docs about projects, etc.

* If Run File is perfomed from within the compile buffer, do a
  recompile.

* C-p r r -- If not even the *compilation* buffer is visible, issue
  Re-Run File from anywhere.

* "perly_sense create_project" renames existing project.yml with
  datestamp



Earlier
-------

* Stuff happened.

* Time passed.

* Code got written. Bugs were introduced and removed. Ideas were had,
  fleshed out, xdiscarded. Sometimes implemented.

But that was then.
