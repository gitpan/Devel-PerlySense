* Bundle regex-tool 1.2

  C-o a r - Assist-with Regex



= 0.0140

* In Class Overview, display documentation for each method, or the
  method name if no doc is found. This is taken from the POD for each
  method.



= 0.0139

* Fiddled with failing test, fixed typo.



= 0.0138

* Tried fixing test which failed on some platforms.



= 0.0137

* Debug diagnostics for the failing test that doesn't appear on
  Windows.



= 0.0136

* In Class Overview, don't display private methods in base classes
  outside the current Project. TBD: config setting for this

* Made headings in Class Overview less huge

* Fixed bug with missing face dependency loaded from another Emacs package



= 0.0135

* Changed key binding for Class Overview from C-o C-c (focusing on
  Class) to C-o C-o (focusing on Overviwe). This is to bring it in
  line with the convention of having the first keystroke be an
  "action", not an "object".

* "perly_sense info" displays Version

* Removed dependency on "grep-mode" which was only used for the faces.

* Faces are now dealt with properly in the customize-group perly-sense
  (if you use PerlySense in text-only mode, please let me know if it
  looks ok).



= 0.0134

* Docs and Goto now works on Methods in the Class Overview.

* Bug: Goto method declaration goes to the POD rather than the sub {}
  if found in base classes.



= 0.0133

* Cookbook.pod added

* Class Overview
  - reorder the things displyed to bring the more useful stuff to the top
  - display API methods in columns



= 0.0132

* "perly_sense info" provides useful information about what the
  current project directory, user home directory, etc. is.

* Class Overview lists the API, i.e. methods and properties.



= 0.0131

* Fixed broken Build.PL which didn't properly install the .el files
  into the lib directory. The Makefile.PL worked earlier though...



= 0.0130

* Fist non-developer release!

* New .emacs load procedure, read the docs again.

* Automatic identification of elisp files using "perly_sense
  external_dir".

* Configurable Emacs prefix. Default is C-o.



= 0.01_29

* Fixed failing test.

* Fixed broken initial project config (bad bookmark regexp)



= 0.01_28

* Fixed another most likely insignificant failing test, added debug
  output for another one. Bring on the CPAN testers! (kudos guys!)



= 0.01_27

* Fixed annoying failing Win/Unix newline test. Nothing else.



= 0.01_26

* Fixed bug #30775: "Flymake not showing Perl::Critic warnings" which
  was caused by redirecting warnings into the debug log.

* Bookmark support (recreate the project config and check out the
  "bookmark" entry).



= 0.01_25

* Fixed: Flymake emits redefined warnings for subs with namespace
  qualifiers.

* Debug logging in the HOME/.PerlySense/log directory

* Warnings go to the debug log



= 0.01_24 =

* Fixed potential breaking flymake elisp.

* If the *compiation* buffer is already visible in any frame, switch
  to that first, so we don't get to see two *compiation* buffers next
  to each other. That just looks silly.

* Perl::Critic using Flymake - first draft



= 0.01_23 =

* Run File uses the Project config, and supports syntax checking .pm
  files, running .pl files, etc. as well.

* New config keys added, so run "perly_sense create_project" to
  re-generate a default project.yml which you can then diff against
  the old one (renamed with datestamp).

* Flymake support - highlight syntax errors and warnings in the source
  while editing (continously or at every save).

  Note: new elisp file to install, and some .emacs configuration.



= 0.01_22 =

* Docs about projects, etc.

* If Run File is perfomed from within the compile buffer, do a
  recompile.

* C-p r r -- If not even the *compilation* buffer is visible, issue
  Re-Run File from anywhere.

* "perly_sense create_project" renames existing project.yml with
  datestamp



= Earlier =

Stuff happened.

Time passed.

Code got written. Bugs were introduced and removed. Ideas were had,
fleshed out, xdiscarded. Sometimes implemented.

But that was then.
